# Live-Tracking-of-Assets-on-Seaport

Developed algorithm in JavaScript for live tracking of assets on seaport with GPS and RFID in order to curb the irregularities happening on the port.
It evaluates, detects and assess security risks to the ships calling at ports for fraud detection.
Based on certain conditions specified by the port, restricted zones are created.
Whenever an asset enters a restricted zone, when permit is expired/expires/invalid, it is alerted at the port officials so that the scope of illegal activities is reduced.
